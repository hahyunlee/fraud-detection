# Fraud Detection

This case study takes data from Eventbrite (Event Ticketing Website) (Therefore data is unavailable to the public) and predicts the probability that the event posted is actually a fraud. This is an end to end pipeline of data science.

Topics included in this case study include:
* Classification modeling.
* Programming Practice: Handing off models. 
* Teamwork.
* Web applications.
* Website hosting with AWS
* Deploying a DS application.
* Data visualization.
* Results presentation.

#### Expectation

* A dashboard for investigators to use which helps them identify new events that are worthy of investigation for fraud.  This will pull in new data regularly, and update a useful display for the investigation team.
